Registrar – Registration and Account Holds

The Registrar’s Office manages course registration and student records.

Registration holds may be placed on student accounts for reasons including:
- Outstanding balances
- Missing documentation
- Academic standing issues
- Administrative reviews

Automated systems may display the presence of a hold but do not determine resolution steps.

Students must contact the Registrar’s Office to review and resolve holds on their account.
