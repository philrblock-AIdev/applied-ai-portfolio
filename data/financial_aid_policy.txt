Financial Aid Office – General Policy Overview

The Financial Aid Office assists students with understanding and managing financial aid awards, including grants, loans, and scholarships.

Aid amounts may change between semesters due to:
- Changes in enrollment status
- Academic progress requirements
- Verification outcomes
- Funding availability

The Financial Aid Office does not provide immediate decisions via automated systems. All changes must be reviewed by authorized staff.

Students with questions about aid adjustments should be directed to a Financial Aid counselor for review.
