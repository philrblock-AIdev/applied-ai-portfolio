# Applied AI / Prompt Engineering Portfolio  
### Higher Education Student Services & HR Support

This repository demonstrates applied, job-ready AI work aligned to Applied AI / Prompt Engineering roles in higher education and enterprise environments.

The focus is on **practical execution**, not theory.

## What This Portfolio Demonstrates

- Prompt framework design and reuse
- Prompt iteration, constraints, and guardrails
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- Document ingestion and knowledge retrieval
- Structured evaluation using rubrics and test cases
- Workflow automation thinking
- Human-in-the-loop AI design

## Domain Focus

Higher Education:
- Student Services
- Human Resources
- IT & Administrative Support

This domain was chosen to reflect real operational workflows in regulated, high-stakes environments.

## How to Review This Portfolio (5–10 minutes)

For reviewers short on time, the recommended order is:

1. **Prompt Design & Iteration**
   - `01_prompt_library/student_services_intake_prompt.md`
   - `01_prompt_library/student_services_intake_prompt_v2.md`

2. **Evaluation & Testing**
   - `03_evaluation/prompt_evaluation_rubric.md`
   - `03_evaluation/student_services_test_cases.md`

3. **Retrieval-Augmented Generation**
   - `02_rag_pipeline/README.md`
   - `src/rag_pipeline.py`

4. **Human-in-the-Loop Workflow**
   - `04_workflows/student_services_intake_workflow.md`

5. **Demo Narrative**
   - `05_demo/demo_script.md`

This order reflects how applied AI systems are designed, validated, and reviewed in real operational environments.
