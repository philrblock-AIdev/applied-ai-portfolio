# Portfolio Scope, Assumptions, and Constraints

## Objective

This portfolio demonstrates practical Applied AI and Prompt Engineering skills through a focused, end-to-end example.

The goal is to show **how AI systems are designed, constrained, evaluated, and integrated into real workflows**, not to build a production-scale system.

## What Is Included

- Prompt frameworks with explicit roles, constraints, and outputs
- Prompt iteration and refinement
- A simple Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline
- Document ingestion using small, realistic datasets
- Evaluation rubrics and test cases
- Human-in-the-loop checkpoints
- Workflow documentation for operational use

## What Is Explicitly Excluded

- Large-scale infrastructure
- Advanced ML training or fine-tuning
- Complex orchestration frameworks
- UI/UX front-end development
- Non-essential tooling

## Assumptions

- Users are non-technical staff in higher education environments
- Accuracy, consistency, and guardrails are more important than creativity
- Human review is required before final outputs are used

## Design Philosophy

- Simple > clever
- Clear > fast
- Auditable > opaque

This reflects how applied AI systems are evaluated and approved in regulated or institutional environments.
